## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `laravel-best-practices` — Apply this skill whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring Laravel PHP code. This includes creating or modifying controllers, models, migrations, form requests, policies, jobs, scheduled commands, service classes, and Eloquent queries. Triggers for N+1 and query performance issues, caching strategies, authorization and security patterns, validation, error handling, queue and job configuration, route definitions, and architectural decisions. Also use for Laravel code reviews and refactoring existing Laravel code to follow best practices. Covers any task involving Laravel backend PHP code patterns.
- `pulse-development` — Handles Laravel Pulse setup, configuration, and custom card development. Activates when installing Pulse; configuring the dashboard or authorization gate; setting up recorders and filtering; building custom Livewire cards; optimizing with Redis ingest or sampling; or when the user mentions /pulse, pulse:check, pulse:work, Pulse::record(), or application monitoring.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Always invoke when the user's message includes 'tailwind' in any form. Also invoke for: building responsive grid layouts (multi-column card grids, product grids), flex/grid page structures (dashboards with sidebars, fixed topbars, mobile-toggle navs), styling UI components (cards, tables, navbars, pricing sections, forms, inputs, badges), adding dark mode variants, fixing spacing or typography, and Tailwind v3/v4 work. The core use case: writing or fixing Tailwind utility classes in HTML templates (Blade, JSX, Vue). Skip for backend PHP logic, database queries, API routes, JavaScript with no HTML/CSS component, CSS file audits, build tool configuration, and vanilla CSS.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel file structure.
- This is perfectly fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing structure from Laravel 10. We do not need to migrate to the new Laravel structure unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Laravel 10 Structure

- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
    - Middleware registration happens in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule register in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application. Follow the existing conventions for how and where it is implemented.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel that lets you define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. Built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Always inspect required options before running a command, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Actions encapsulate a button with an optional modal form and logic:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data))

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Always authenticate before testing panel functionality. Filament uses Livewire, so use `Livewire::test()` or `livewire()` (available when `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` is in `composer.json`):

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'name' => 'Test',
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling actions in pages" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->callAction(DeleteAction::class)
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertRedirect();

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling actions in tables" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` do not span all columns by default. Explicitly set column spans when needed.

=== ralphjsmit/guidelines rules ===

# Coding standards

- When creating a new branch, it MUST start with `rjs/`. This applies also to renaming existing branches.
- Do NOT run Laravel Pint or any other code linter/formatter. This is always automatically performed on CI.
- When writing headings, do not capitalize each word.
- Always launch Opus subagents.
- When committing, NEVER use any "Generated by Claude" or "Generated by Cursor" bylines in the commit message.

# PHP standards

Follow PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-12. **Follow Laravel conventions first.**

## Naming and types

- camelCase for non-public-facing strings, PascalCase for enum values
- Short nullable: `?string` not `string|null`
- Always specify `void` return types
- Use string interpolation over concatenation

## Truthy checks

- Use truthy/falsy directly: `if ($items)` not `if (count($items) > 0)`
- Never use `empty()` — rely on falsy instead

## Class structure

- Typed properties, not docblocks
- Constructor property promotion when all properties can be promoted
- One trait per line
- Only `public` or `protected` methods — NEVER `private`
- Constructor promotion: each property on its own line, even with one property:

```php
public function __construct(
    protected AuthenticateSatisRequest $request
) {}
```

## Docblocks

- Omit docblocks for fully type-hinted methods (unless description needed)
- Always import classnames — never fully qualified names in docblocks
- Always format over 3 lines, never single-line (`/** @var string */` is wrong, use 3 lines)
- Most common type first in multi-type docblocks
- If one param needs docblock, document all params
- Document iterables with generics: `Collection<int, User>`, `array<int, MyObject>`
- Array shapes on multiple lines: `array{ first: SomeClass, second: SomeClass, }`

## Control flow

- Happy path last: handle errors first, success case last
- Avoid `else`: use early returns
- Always use curly brackets, even for single statements
- Multi-line ternaries: each part on its own line

## Functions

- ALWAYS put function definitions on one line, never span across multiple lines, regardless of argument count:

```php
public function execute(Leg $leg, AppTrackingType $appTrackingType, string $description, ?string $url, Model $trackable): AppTracking
```

## Method chaining

- When chaining 2+ methods, put each `->` call on its own line:

```php
Notification::make()
    ->title('Satis build queued')
    ->success()
    ->send();
```

## Comments and whitespace

- Avoid comments — write expressive code instead
- Add blank lines between statements for readability
- No extra empty lines between `{}` brackets

# Laravel conventions

## Routes

- URLs: kebab-case (`/open-source`), route names: kebab-case, parameters: camelCase (`{userId}`)
- Use tuple notation: `[Controller::class, 'method']`

## Controllers

- Plural resource names (`PostController`), stick to CRUD methods
- Extract new controllers for non-CRUD actions

## Configuration

- Config files: kebab-case, config keys: snake_case
- Add service configs to `config/services.php`, don't create new files
- Use `config()` helper, never `env()` outside config files

## Artisan commands

- Names: kebab-case (`delete-old-records`)
- Put output BEFORE processing each item (easier debugging)

## Migrations

- NEVER use `cascadeOnDelete()` or `cascadeOnUpdate()`. Only use `constrained()`, and defer cascade logic to an observer.

## Validation

- Use array notation for rules: `'email' => ['required', 'email']`

## Blade templates

- Indent with 4 spaces, one space after control structures: `@if ($condition)`

## Authorization

- Policies use camelCase, CRUD words, `view` instead of `show`

## Translations

- Use `__()` over `@lang`

## Strings

- NEVER use PHP string functions (`str_contains()`, `strtolower()`). Always use `Str::contains()`, `Str::lower()` etc.
- For chained operations, use `str()` helper

## Carbon

- NEVER use `Carbon\Carbon`. Always use `Illuminate\Support\Carbon`.

## Collections

- Only use `Collection` when returning a collection that must be wrapped, or when chaining multiple operations
- Use PHP array functions for single operations

## Eloquent queries

- Always wrap `or` conditions in a `->where()` closure
- Always `return` nested query closures (return type `Builder`, not `void`)
- Use `->whereBelongsTo($model)` instead of hard-coding relation keys
- Use `$model->getKey()` not `$model->id`, `->getQualifiedKeyName()` not `->qualifyColumn('id')`

## Naming conventions

- Classes: PascalCase, methods/variables: camelCase, routes: kebab-case
- Config files: kebab-case, config keys: snake_case, artisan commands: kebab-case

## File structure

- Controllers: `PostController`, views: `open-source.blade.php`
- Jobs: `CreateUserJob`, events: `UserCreated`, listeners: `SendUserCreatedNotificationListener`
- Commands: `PublishScheduledPostsCommand`, notifications: `UserCreatedNotification`
- Resources: `UserResource`, enums: `OrderStatus`, `BookingType`

## Testing

- Keep test classes in same file when possible
- Descriptive test method names, arrange-act-assert pattern
